#DESCRIPTION

Allows you to change the amount of rounds required to win the game. You will need to change this before joining a lobby, done in the ingame F1 menu. The host sets the round amount. 

#Usage:

While ingame, press F1 to bring up the UnboundLib menu in the top left corner. Click Set Rounds per Game, then enter in the amount of rounds you want to play to. Whoever hosts the lobby sets the round amount.

#Installation:

If you aren't using R2ModMan or Thunderstore Mod Manager, place RemovePostFX.dll into your BepInEx/plugins folder. 

If you have any issues, you can contact me @Ascyst#4219.
